# 10 Vegetables You Can Plant Once and Eat Forever

When it comes to sustainable gardening, there's nothing better than planting vegetables that will continue to produce year after year with little effort from you. These "perennial vegetables" are hardy, low-maintenance, and provide a long-term food source for your homestead or garden. In this post, we'll highlight 10 vegetables you can plant once and harvest for years to come!

## 1. **Asparagus**  
Asparagus is a well-known perennial vegetable that can last for decades when properly cared for. Once planted, it will keep producing spears each spring without needing to be replanted. The best part? Asparagus grows back every year, becoming more abundant with age!

- **Planting Tips:** Choose a sunny spot with well-drained soil. Give it plenty of room to spread as it will grow in large clumps.
- **Harvesting Tips:** Don’t harvest too much the first year, allow the plants to get established. After 2-3 years, you'll have a reliable spring harvest.

## 2. **Rhubarb**  
Rhubarb is a hardy perennial that thrives in cool climates. It’s perfect for making pies, jams, and other desserts, though you should only eat the stalks as the leaves are toxic.

- **Planting Tips:** Rhubarb prefers slightly acidic soil and a sunny location. Space it out to allow for its large leaves to grow.
- **Harvesting Tips:** Harvest stalks in early spring before they become too thick. Don’t harvest too many stalks at once to give the plant time to regenerate.

## 3. **Kale (Perennial Varieties)**  
While most varieties of kale are grown as annuals, some types, like **Tree Kale** and **Daubenton**, are perennial and will regrow every year. These varieties have a milder flavor and can continue to produce throughout the year.

- **Planting Tips:** Plant in a well-drained spot with plenty of sunlight. Perennial kale likes cool weather but can tolerate a range of temperatures.
- **Harvesting Tips:** Harvest leaves throughout the growing season, but always leave enough so the plant can continue to grow.

## 4. **Horseradish**  
If you love a spicy kick in your food, horseradish is an excellent choice. It’s an aggressive perennial that can thrive in almost any soil condition. Once planted, you’ll have an abundant supply of horseradish root to harvest.

- **Planting Tips:** Plant in rich, well-drained soil, and be prepared for the plant to spread.
- **Harvesting Tips:** Harvest the roots in the fall after the plant has fully matured, and use them fresh or preserved.

## 5. **Artichokes**  
Artichokes are perennial in zones 7-10 and can be grown as long as they are cared for properly. They produce stunning flowers that can also be eaten when they’re still in bud form.

- **Planting Tips:** Choose a sunny location and well-drained soil. Artichokes are very hardy but need protection from frost in colder climates.
- **Harvesting Tips:** Harvest the buds before they flower. Leave some buds on the plant to allow for a second harvest.

## 6. **Garlic Chives**  
Garlic chives are a perennial herb that can add a mild garlic flavor to your dishes all year long. Once established, they return each spring and will continue to produce throughout the growing season.

- **Planting Tips:** Garlic chives prefer full sun and well-drained soil. They can be grown in containers or in the ground.
- **Harvesting Tips:** Cut the leaves as needed and leave some for regrowth. The flowers are also edible and add a decorative touch to your garden.

## 7. **Jerusalem Artichokes (Sunchokes)**  
Jerusalem artichokes, also known as sunchokes, are tubers that grow underground. They have a nutty, sweet flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, from soups to stir-fries.

- **Planting Tips:** Plant in well-drained soil in a sunny spot. Be warned, these plants can spread quickly and take over your garden if you’re not careful.
- **Harvesting Tips:** Harvest the tubers in late fall after the foliage has died back. The longer they stay in the ground, the sweeter they get!

## 8. **Perennial Onions (Welsh Onion, Egyptian Walking Onion)**  
Perennial onions like **Welsh onions** and **Egyptian walking onions** are great for low-maintenance, year-round harvesting. They don’t form bulbs like traditional onions, but their stalks can be harvested for use in cooking.

- **Planting Tips:** Plant in a sunny spot with well-drained soil. These onions will spread, so give them enough space to grow.
- **Harvesting Tips:** Cut the stalks throughout the year. You can also harvest the small bulbs that form at the top of the Egyptian walking onion.

## 9. **Sorrel**  
Sorrel is a leafy green herb that has a tangy, lemony flavor. It’s perfect for salads or as an addition to soups and sauces. Sorrel grows back every year and can handle even cold temperatures.

- **Planting Tips:** Plant in well-drained soil with partial shade. Sorrel is a hardy perennial that grows best in temperate climates.
- **Harvesting Tips:** Harvest leaves as needed, starting in the spring. Sorrel can be cut back after the first harvest to encourage regrowth.

## 10. **Fennel (Florence Fennel)**  
Fennel is a perennial herb that can be used in salads, soups, and as a seasoning. The bulb and fronds are both edible, and the plant will return each year if given the right conditions.

- **Planting Tips:** Plant fennel in full sun and well-drained soil. It's best to keep it isolated from other crops as it can cross-pollinate with other plants.
- **Harvesting Tips:** Harvest the bulbs before they flower. The fronds can be used throughout the growing season.
